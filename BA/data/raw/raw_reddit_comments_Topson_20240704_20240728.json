Having far too many hours in each of these games, Dota wins 100% of the time on character feel. Also, I don't have to pay for new characters, which makes it wild that it has the best characters.",

Its basically so you know what they are up to.\n\nAnd its not a bad thing, the whole story is written with a touch of witty sarcastic sitcom, which Valve likes.",

But the second half of my second paragraph implies that the reason most of his characters sounded nearly the same to start with was because the voice director told him to do it that way at the beginning. Coupled with the fact that his normal voice sounds nothing like any of his characters, and I think he did basically what he was told for his characters perfectly.",

Something about voice actors passing away makes me feel like any addition to the game is going to be incomplete from now on.  I felt the same way when I found out Jim French died, the voice of Elder Titan and Father Grigori.  I know ET is mostly a self-contained character in the lore, and Father Grigori probably didn't survive the reactor meltdown from city 17, but it still feels like an important member of the Valve VA team was lost.",

But its 100% a net gain because it has allowed so many heros to have actually cohesive tool kits after a decade of existence.\n\nLike look at Lich, prior to his rework his kit just straight up made no sense, did anyone ever notice that? Like he had his Q, he had a W that gave like +2 armor, his E which killed creeps and his ult. There was just no synergy there. Now his E synergizes with both his Ulti and his Q by grouping enemies up. His W synergizes with both his Ulti and his Shard by slowing/enabling bounces.\n\nLike I miss his funny \"haha laning is miserable for the enemy\" button, but it didn't really make an interesting hero.",

You would not catch me dead playing pre 7.00 dota after 3k~ hours of nearly exclusive supporting back then.\n\nBuying courier, 200 G wards, double dust purchasing, sentries costing an arm and a leg, and the map/objectives/kill assist bounties all just giving nothing to supports.\n\nThe support role was literally the role of \"I get to sacrifice my own enjoyment of the game and have a miserable time because someone has to or else we lose yaay!\"\n\nYou still see it in modern Overwatch design, queuing as a support has to give you a bunch of free rewards V-Bucks and junk because supports in that game still just aren't fun. Moira was allowed to do things in the game and they decided that was not OK. The supports purpose in Blizzard design philosophy (and old dota) is to bend over and get fucked so the cool guy carry who first picked, bitched and moaned until he got his way can feel cooler.",

EVERY GAME it devolves into 5v5 by 12 minutes pretty much. if a fight breaks out, everyone needs to tp there. old dota, if you forced a support to TP mid, that was INSANE value, it actually meant something. TPs used to actually be impactful, now its pretty much a summoner spell that everyone has like in league.\n\ni think that the game is more playable now, but its overall so much easier and less crunchy than it used to be. i liked weird damage types, where venge W wouldnt intturupt a clarity because it was hp removal. i liked beastmaster axes doing composite damage and being literally useless, i liked tiny Q W combo doing air + ground damage. i liekd clarities being canceled by jungle camps. i liked there only being 1 courier, it made lanes actually matter, to where you cant just ship out infinite regen. the game has gotten completely homoginized, and it can feel rather samey.\n\nbut stacking wards and backpacks was an incredible idea. best thing they've ever done BESIDES removing healing on shrines. i actually stopped playing dota for about a year because of healing shrines being the worst change they have ever made. and i respect the HELL out of icefrog for just removing and it and being like \"eh, this was a horrible idea, sorry guys\".\n\neating aghs and aghs shard also very cool.\n\n  \ni dont say all of this to just argue or whatever, i like dota a lot and i think the recent updates have been really cool. but i do miss the good old days. dota simply isnt the game i fell in love with when i was 12",

Here's the [Liquipedia](https://liquipedia.net/warcraft/Lich) link.\n\nThe only spell DotA replaced with a completely different spell is his old ult Death and Decay. Later they removed Sacrifice from Dota 2 because it didn't fit into the modern game anymore.\n\nPersonally I'm not a big fan of his current innate because I can't buy clarities or mana regen items to sustain my spells and that forces me to stand near our creep wave and soak XP away from my carry or else I can't use spells.  \nOr I can buy up our team's entire supply of mangoes just to be able to lane without sandbagging my carry's levels, but doing so has a potentially negative effect on other lanes.",

The series made it look like Insania has a way more shallow hero-pool than he does, his Chen is excellent and taking it away from GG seems an obvious move. But obviously they know something I don't.\n\nThe Morphling also looks real good, but perhaps not when your main fear is lanes collapsing in the first 10 minutes.",

It's clear when there's a solo Jakiro or Enigma lingering in front of you and you don't go for the kill because you're too afraid. Saying that Nisha is playing like shit is disrespectful and pathetic, especially considering they are facing the best team of the tournament. Nisha has outperformed every other midlaner, and CCnC is a monster. If Nisha is playing badly, then what does that make you? Criticizing players with such a negative attitude is unwarranted.",

I was disarmed by his skill (already used Vendetta, Impale, and Carapace at this point) and I was spam clicking my Mind Flare. I raged at my keyboard thinking it was the problem. I realized later like \"WTF. HUSKAR HAS NO MANA SO I CAN'T MIND FLARE!\" then I just laughed. A few seconds later my teammates pinging my W. I had to explain that I can't Mind Flare Huskar because he has no mana and that I reacted the same way as them at first.\n\nEdit: Let me correct myself here. I watched the replay and found that I was not disarmed but didn't have enough physical damage to kill him with normal hits.I wasn't silenced too. He cannot cast Inner Fire because he used it first before I hit him with Vendetta. As an old Nyx player, it is muscle memory to cast Mind Flare after Vendetta hit and Impale. So yeah, no mana, no Mind Flare. Unlike AM ult that you can still cast on Huskar but with no damage, Mind Flare cannot target Huskar.",

        "comment_body": "Tbh I don't think it will be an issue. As far as I have seen the changes only focus in three things:\n\n* Arcana efffects, personality, etc is no longer in an \"equipment\" slot. It's in a separate slot called \"base\" in my language.\n* Arcana \"parts\" are then separate, so you can decide to equip them with the Arcana on (effects and all) or without the Arcana on (only the equipment). This is similar to modern Arcana sets, which includes \"normal\" items tagged as arcana rarity as part of the set that you can unequip if you want or equip separate from the Arcana, such as Skeleton King's sword.\n* Special interactions are introduced among item slots for particular aesthetic combinations.\n\nSo, for example. Jugg's arcana was just a head, years ago people complaiend about the voicelines and they added a \"voice\" equipment slot to have the Arcana on without the voices. Now they did the same with the head, that can be equiped separately and the Arcana effects go to a \"base\" slot.\n\nPudge can now equip the Arcana effects on his \"base\" slot. The \"hooks\" on the Arcana's back are now just an item in the back/stomach slot, and can be equiped on normal pudge without Arcana effects on. Certain item combinations still pop up the \"back hooks\" if you have the Arcana equipped with the back slot being used by something else, for example, the new set has a eye and mouth on Pudge's belly for the back slot, if you equip the Arcana the back hooks will appear with it and the belly will remain combining both looks, however if you then change the Eye-belly to a different item the the back-hooks will be gone.\n\nThese kind of interactions are similar to the previous Kringle King (skeleton king) set interactions with the Skeleton king arcana. You can equip the kringle king set on Wraith to get the WK Santa look, but the arcana for skeleton king is in the head slot so you shouldn't be able to equip the santa beard with the Arcana, ruining the set. The game solves this by allowing you to equip the Kringle cape, which automatically gives you the Kringle helmet with the santa beard without taking the helmet slot if you are using the Arcana, but not with other WK sets.\n\nI mean, it's a little weird to explain, but the idea is that it's best of both worlds for most scenarios. I am hoping they add this to other older arcanas with weird slots such as Zeus. In fact I hope they do this with the stupid Skeleton King throne, which bugs with most of it's sets and is forced on you on the preview screen while you use the Arcana.\n\nRazor's arcana is also the worst fucking nightmare to combine with other sets, and it's voicelines are nothing to write home about so I hope they break it down too.",

Basically as rubik you were always guaranteed a chrono steal if you weren’t caught in it or didn’t die in it. Other big ults like stampede, reapers scythe, or even black hole come with a plethora of other spells to help prevent them being stolen. So I like to think that it’s just an outdated balancing mechanic that’s remained for flavor reasons.",

League of Legends suffers from a massive favouritism issue with only a minority of champions getting consistent love at any one time, and there are some that are far too evergreen in the meta.\n\nDota 2 is a bit less cookie-cutter than League, meaning more heroes have a chance to shine in their own ways. My favourite champion, Yorick, only really has one way to play and can't threaten with any other build, for example.",

        "comment_body": "EWC in League only had 18 games played since it was only one playoff series with single eliminations.\n\nBut this is usually the case for League when it comes to pro play. Last years Worlds had 90 champs picked and 77 unpicked. Alot of the champs unpicked are just bad for pro play because they require special circumstances to pick them or they are to easily countered by teams having good communication. Alot of the unpicked champs are good in regular play just not in pro. \n\nSome examples: \n\nRammus is a champ that can get up to 90% physical resist when he uses his W and is very good when the enemy team picks 5 champs that does AD damage. A pro team picking 5 AD champs is nearly unheard of so he does not see alot of play. He is also very slow and kitable which is not a huge problem in regular play but easily punishable in pro play.\n\nRengar is a assassin champ that wants to kill of players that are out of position or alone. But in pro play were players are constantly communicating with eachother and move around the map together the chance for Rengar to actually be viable is slim to none. Imagine playing \n\nVeigar and Nasus are both infinity stackers that needs time to get online and deal alot of damage. This is not good in pro play since players can easily punish them since they are weak early and need alot of time to come online. League pro games are also shorter than normal play which means the game will be over before they have had the chance to even come online. \n\nThis is both good and bad for the game. The bad side is that pro play often can become stale with the same champs picked over and over again. The good side is that less champs are balanced after pro play like some heroes are in Dota(Pango, Ember, Beastmaster,  etc).",

Since there is no gold lost and no BB, timings revolve around level spikes/large item pickup spikes.       \n\nDue to overlapping kits and a smaller map with objective timing focus you want to play the most optimal champion on the current patch. Unfortunately there is only so many bans and 10 picks so a majority of the pool won’t be used at any given tournament. When the first 15mins of the game can determine the winner you won’t draft speculative picks.   \n\nA majority of the unpicked here was meta at some points during the last two years. So it isn’t the kits that are bad, but the numbers of a shift in meta focus.",

Riot is all about quantity over quality, keep pumping out new champions to pump up player retention and revenue gain, balance be damned. Valve takes a slower and careful approach to hero balance and takes great care in adding a new hero to ensure they fit well into the game and will have a solid and impactful role for years. The fact that out of the 124 heroes only 18 went unpicked/unbanned is really good, it shows they're trying to give every hero a role in the meta. League however has 168 champions and the fact that over half of them are unpicked/unbanned is quite telling to the lack of care to balance Riot has.",

        "comment_body": "The thing with League is based on how much I've played of it, the game's meta centers around which class of champions are buffed most recently. Dota 2's meta is based on items. Best example is that most heroes that favor durability/tankiness are hard to go against currently but its not the hero that is the problem most of the time, its the items they use/pick, I mean during TI2022, Tide was ok-ish, the hero has never been OP really afaik, but man Wraith Pact is and Tide and most offlaners just pick that SOB.  \n\nLike with this list alone you can see that most assassins (physical and magical based) are currently off meta with only a few champions in the tank and healer category being unpicked, either because another tank is better, or they are not good on the meta currently (number adjustments, cast animations changed etc). Like Vayne being here is surprising because she's a very good, ranged carry but I guess she is off meta right now so as Veigar, Aurelion Sol and Sona. It's tantamount to not picking Windranger, Pugna, Jakiro and Crystal Maiden.",

Here is a copypasta.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/7LA5It2\n\nI gathered the statistics from Dota 2 Pro Tracker and whatever League's pub database is since they lack a tracker for their professional players. The graph is a histogram representing the number of heroes and champions winrates within buckets of 1%.\n\nAs you can see, these histograms tell some very different stories. Some interesting statistics.\n\n### Win Rates\n**Out of the 167 champions in League:**\n\n- 132 (79%) of them fall between 48% and 52% winrate.\n- 0 of them fall below 45% winrate\n- 0 of them are above 55% winrate\n\n**Out of 124 heroes in Dota:**\n\n- 63 (50%) of them fall between 48% and 52% winrate.\n- 13(!!!!!) of them fall below 45% winrate\n- 2 of them are above 55% winrate\n\nKeep in mind for the following statistics, League had 110 games played, and Dota had 150 total, throughout the tournament (yes, it does matter). These are relatively small datasets when running numbers for hundreds of different heroes/champs.\n\nWorlds 2023: https://liquipedia.net/leagueoflegends/World_Championship/2023/Statistics\n\nInternational 2023: https://liquipedia.net/dota2/The_International/2023/Statistics\n\n### Pick Rates\n**Out of the 167 champions in League:**\n\n- 15 of them had contest rates (picked or banned) of 50% or above (very meta)\n- 48 of them had contest rates of 10% or above (pickable)\n- 40 were picked between 1 and 5 times\n- 18 were picked exactly 1 time\n\n**Out of the 124 heroes in Dota:**\n\n- 14 of them had contest rates of 50% or above\n- 57 of them had contest rates of 10% or above\n- 48 were picked between 1 and 5 times\n- 12 of them were picked exactly 1 time\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind here is that Dota has an extra 6 bans compared to League, so for every game you're getting 20 vs 26 heroes to champions, which is a massive difference for a dataset such as this. There isn't really a smart mathematical way to project what these bans would go to, but I'm pretty confident League could have an equivalent if not **more** diverse meta (in terms of pure number of viable characters) than Dota.",
